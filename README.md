# Dart Linear Regression

This project implements a linear regression algorithm in Dart programming language. Linear regression is a simple machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to implement a linear regression algorithm in Dart using the `ml_algo` and `ml_dataframe` packages. The project provides functionality to train a linear regression model, make predictions, and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Features

- Train a linear regression model using training data
- Make predictions on new data
- Calculate Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for evaluating model performance
